**The world's most powerful open-source AI platform for building production-ready machine learning models — no expertise required.**

**Obsidian Networks eliminates everything that slows you down.** No more hunting through research papers. No more wrestling with boilerplate. No more debugging cryptic TensorFlow errors at 2am. No more paying consultants to do something a machine can do better, faster, and with full citations.

**Upload a dataset. Describe what you want. Walk away with a trained model.**

**Healthcare teams** use it to predict patient outcomes from clinical records. **Financial institutions** use it to detect fraud, forecast risk, and build trading signals. **Retailers** use it to model churn, optimise pricing, and forecast demand. **Manufacturers** use it to predict equipment failure before it happens. **Researchers** use it to prototype and validate ideas in minutes instead of weeks. **Startups** use it to build ML capabilities without hiring a data science team. If your industry runs on data — and every industry does — **Obsidian Networks turns that data into intelligence.**

**What it takes away from you:**
- **Weeks of research** — replaced by an agent that reads the actual papers
- **Days of boilerplate** — replaced by a cited, reviewed, production-ready training script
- **Hours of debugging** — replaced by a self-healing compile loop that fixes its own errors
- **Expertise gatekeeping** — replaced by a platform that guides you from raw CSV to deployed model
- **Cloud lock-in** — replaced by a fully self-hostable stack you own completely

**This is not a code assistant. This is a research engineer, architect, and ML developer — working in parallel, grounded in literature, and available to anyone.**

## What is Obsidian Networks?

**Obsidian Networks** is an AI-powered platform that generates **complete machine learning pipelines** from a simple description of your problem.

Instead of manually researching architectures, writing training code, debugging errors, and configuring environments, the platform automates the entire workflow.

Upload your dataset → describe your goal → receive a fully functional training script and trained model.

The generated code follows modern TensorFlow/Keras practices and is designed to be **production-ready, transparent, and editable**.

## TL;DR — Model Recommendations

Based on initial testing across providers, model quality for this use case ranks as follows:

**Claude (Anthropic) > GPT-4o (OpenAI) > Large local models via LM Studio**

- **Claude** (Sonnet / Opus) produces the most thorough research — it reliably calls all research tools before writing code, follows multi-step instructions precisely, and generates clean, runnable training scripts with minimal patching needed.
- **GPT-4o** performs well and follows tool-use instructions consistently, though it does less unprompted research than Claude.
- **LM Studio** (local models) works best with larger models (13B+). Smaller models tend to skip research tool calls and occasionally produce scripts with minor syntax issues. The platform automatically patches the most common errors, but output quality is noticeably lower than cloud providers.

If you are self-hosting for privacy or cost reasons, use the largest model your hardware supports. For best results, use Claude.

### Self-Healing Scripts

When a generated training script fails to compile, the platform automatically feeds the error message back to the AI model so it can diagnose and fix the problem — then regenerates the script and retries, without any manual intervention. This loop runs silently in the background; you will see the chat update with a fix and the compile button become available again once the corrected script is ready.

## Why Obsidian Networks?

Most ML platforms assume you already know how to build models. **Obsidian Networks** inverts that assumption.

- **No ML expertise required** — Describe your goal in plain English. The AI selects the architecture, verifies the API, writes the code, and trains the model.
- **Research-backed output** — Before generating a single line of code, the agent searches arXiv, reads abstracts to select relevant papers, and downloads the full PDFs directly into a local FAISS vector store. Keras/TF API docs are pulled from Context7 and indexed alongside the papers. Every architectural decision in the plan traces back to a specific retrieved chunk with a source URL.
- **End-to-end in one session** — From raw CSV to a trained `.keras` file without switching tools, writing boilerplate, or managing environments.
- **Time series support** — Upload hourly or daily data and receive a complete LSTM or Temporal Fusion Transformer script with correct temporal windowing and no data leakage.
- **Reinforcement learning support** — Describe an RL problem — trading agent, game controller, robot policy — and receive a complete Gymnasium environment, actor/critic networks, and a training loop.
- **Fully local option** — Point the platform at a local [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) server. Your data, models, and prompts never touch a cloud API.
- **Self-hosted & open-source** — One `docker compose up --build`. Your infrastructure, your data, your keys.

---

## How It Works

```
Upload dataset  →  Describe your goal  →  Research  →  Plan  →  Build  →  Download
```

**1. Research**
The AI agent searches arXiv for relevant papers, reads the abstracts to select the most relevant ones, then downloads the **full PDFs directly** into a per-session FAISS vector store. TensorFlow/Keras API docs are fetched from [Context7](https://context7.com) — returning real code snippets and current API signatures from keras.io — and also indexed into the vector store. No content is truncated or discarded; everything is chunked and embedded for retrieval during planning.

**2. Plan**
The agent queries the vector store with targeted questions (architecture type, layer sizes, activations, optimizer, regularisation, evaluation metrics) and synthesises findings into a **structured Plan Document** — covering problem framing, feature engineering, architecture with mathematical justification, hyperparameters with citations, and training strategy. Every decision cites a specific retrieved chunk with its source URL. The plan is presented to you for review before any code is written.

**3. Build**
Only after you approve the plan does the agent generate code. Every architecture decision in the script is traceable back to the approved plan. The script is validated and saved as a downloadable Jupyter notebook.

**4. Compile**
Click **Compile & Train**. The backend validates the script at the AST level and runs it in an isolated subprocess inside a hardened Docker sandbox. Progress, per-epoch metrics, and loss/accuracy charts stream back to the UI in real time via SSE.

**5. Download**
Grab your trained `.keras` model file(s), the auto-generated Jupyter notebook, and any training plots from the Downloads panel — ready to deploy or continue iterating anywhere.

## Features

### Supervised Learning

Automatic task detection for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression. Preprocessing is handled entirely through Keras layers — `Normalization`, `StringLookup`, `TextVectorization` — so the trained model is fully portable with no sklearn pipelines or pandas transforms at inference time. EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint are included in every generated script.

---

### Time Series Forecasting

Upload any time-indexed CSV and describe a forecasting goal. The platform detects datetime columns, infers the sampling frequency, and selects an appropriate architecture.

| Architecture | When used | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **LSTM** | General sequence modelling, univariate or multivariate | `model.keras` |
| **Stacked LSTM** | Longer sequences, more complex patterns | `model.keras` |
| **Temporal Fusion Transformer** | Multi-horizon forecasting with interpretability | `model.keras` |

Key guarantees in every generated time series script:
- Temporal train/val/test split (no shuffling — prevents data leakage)
- `keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array` for correct sliding-window batching
- EarlyStopping with patience=20 on validation loss
- Up to 200 epochs with checkpointing

---

### Reinforcement Learning

Describe an RL problem in plain English and the platform generates a complete Gymnasium environment, the appropriate network architecture, and a trajectory-based training loop using `env.step()` / `env.reset()` — never `model.fit()`. No file upload required.

| Algorithm | When to use | Output files |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **PPO** | Continuous or complex action spaces | `actor.keras` + `critic.keras` |
| **DQN** | Simple discrete action spaces | `qnetwork.keras` |
| **SAC** | Off-policy continuous control | `actor.keras` + `critic_1.keras` + `critic_2.keras` |

The AI always searches arXiv for RL-specific papers before selecting an algorithm, and the reward function rationale is documented inline in every generated script.

---

### Training Visualisation

Live loss/accuracy charts appear inline during compilation, streamed epoch-by-epoch via SSE — no page refresh needed.

- Dual-axis layout: loss on the left y-axis, accuracy percentage on the right
- Click the expand icon to open a full-size chart with tooltip, legend, and stat pills
- Epochs badge in the Downloads panel shows how many epochs ran and whether EarlyStopping fired (e.g. `Trained for 47 epochs · early stopped / 200 max`)
- Built with Recharts + shadcn-style `ChartContainer`

---

### Plot Gallery

Generated scripts automatically save matplotlib figures to the session output directory. After compilation completes, any PNG/JPG/SVG files appear as a thumbnail gallery in the Downloads panel.

- Click any thumbnail to open a full-size lightbox dialog
- The panel shows a `Saving plots…` spinner after compilation while images are written to disk
- Useful for visualising training history, confusion matrices, feature importance, prediction error, and any other plots your script produces

---

### Multi-Provider LLM

Switch between providers without changing your workflow. Each provider uses the most efficient context management strategy available.

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | Cloud | Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 |
| **OpenAI** | Cloud | GPT-4o, o3, any available model |
| **LM Studio** | Local | Any OpenAI-compatible local model |

**Context efficiency per provider:**

- **Anthropic** — Prompt caching (`cache_control: ephemeral`) is applied to the system prompt on every request, so the ~2k-token system prompt is read from cache rather than re-processed each turn. Server-side `contextManagement` automatically clears old tool-use results (arXiv abstracts, TF doc fetches) when the context approaches 60k input tokens, keeping only the 3 most recent tool turns. This dramatically reduces cost and latency on long sessions.
- **OpenAI / LM Studio** — `pruneMessages` strips tool call results older than the last 5 message turns before sending, keeping the context window lean without losing conversation continuity.

---

### Notebook Export

Every training script is saved as a `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Download it and continue iterating locally, on Google Colab, on Kaggle, or anywhere a Jupyter kernel runs.

The notebook includes a **per-platform environment setup cell** at the top — no more hunting for the right install command:

| Platform | What's included |
|---|---|
| **CPU (Linux / WSL2)** | venv setup, `tensorflow-cpu` install |
| **NVIDIA GPU (Linux / WSL2)** | `tensorflow[and-cuda]` install, GPU verification snippet |
| **Google Colab** | Pre-installed TF note, extra deps only |

When you request changes to a model — new architecture, different optimizer, added dropout — the AI updates the full script and calls `create_notebook` again, overwriting the previous version so you always have the latest.

---

### Session Privacy

Sessions are anonymous and ephemeral. Uploaded datasets and generated files are stored in an isolated per-session directory on the host and purged automatically after a configurable TTL (default: 4 hours). Nothing is persisted in a database.

---

### Self-Hosted

One command starts the full stack: Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Celery worker, and Redis.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

No external services required beyond your LLM API key.

```

**How it works:**

1. The Next.js frontend proxies all `/api/platform/*` requests to the FastAPI backend via `next.config.ts` rewrites. Large file uploads bypass the proxy entirely, going directly to the backend at `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_URL` to avoid buffering limits.
2. The AI chat route (`app/api/chat/route.ts`) operates in three strict phases gated by a backend state machine:
   - **Research phase**: `search_arxiv` returns paper abstracts for the model to evaluate; `ingest_arxiv_paper` downloads the full PDF by arXiv ID directly to the FAISS vector store (no URL guessing, no truncation); `fetch_tensorflow_docs` fetches authoritative Keras/TF code snippets from Context7 (keras.io + tensorflow/docs) and ingests them into the same vector store
   - **Planning phase**: `query_research` retrieves relevant chunks; `produce_plan` submits a cited markdown plan document for user approval
   - **Build phase** (unlocked after user approves): `run_code`, `edit_script`, `create_notebook` — code generation grounded in the approved plan
3. The agent writes the training script via `edit_script(old_str="__REPLACE_ALL__", ...)`, then calls `create_notebook` with only a description. The backend reads the saved script, applies AST/regex patches, validates it, and wraps it in a `.ipynb` notebook.
4. The Celery worker validates the script at the AST level, runs it in a subprocess with a stripped environment, and writes `.keras` files and plot images to the session's output directory.
5. Training progress and per-epoch metrics stream back to the frontend via Server-Sent Events; completed model files and plots appear in the Downloads panel.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) | Latest | Container runtime |
| [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) | v2+ | Multi-service orchestration |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Any | Clone the repository |
| LLM API key | — | Anthropic, OpenAI, or LM Studio |

#### Install Docker

**Windows / macOS** — Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Docker Compose is included.

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   # log out and back in after this
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Verify the install:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

#### Build the base image (one-time setup)

Before running the app for the first time, build the worker base image. This installs all Python ML dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) and takes 5–10 minutes once:

```bash
docker build -f backend/Dockerfile.base -t obsidian-webdev-base:latest backend/
```

> This only needs to be done once. Re-run it if you change `backend/Dockerfile.base`.

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sup3rus3r/obsidian-networks.git
cd obsidian-networks

cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set:
#   AUTH_SECRET — generate one with: openssl rand -base64 32
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or OPENAI_API_KEY, or LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL)

docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **After changing backend code or environment variables**, rebuild only the worker (faster than a full rebuild):
> ```bash
> docker compose build worker && docker compose up -d worker
> ```

### Local Development

**Requirements:** Linux or WSL2, Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 18+, Redis (`sudo apt install redis`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sup3rus3r/obsidian-networks.git
cd obsidian-networks

# Install dependencies
cd backend && uv sync && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env   # fill in your keys
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local   # set AI_PROVIDER and API key

# Start everything with one command
npm run dev
```

This starts Next.js, FastAPI, the Celery worker, and Redis in a single terminal with colour-coded output. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The dev server proxies all `/api/platform/*` requests to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Environment Variables

All configuration lives in `.env` at the repo root (Docker) or `frontend/.env.local` (local dev). See `.env.example` and `backend/.env.example` for full documentation.

## Sample Datasets

Two sample datasets are included in the repository root to get started immediately:

### `heart_failure_dataset.csv` — Binary Classification
918 patients with 11 clinical features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, max heart rate, exercise angina, ST depression (Oldpeak), and ST slope. Target column: `HeartDisease` (0 = no disease, 1 = disease).

**Try:** *"Build a binary classifier to predict heart disease risk. Use a deep neural network with dropout regularisation."*

## Security Model

### AST Validation

Generated scripts are validated at the AST level before execution. An allowlist restricts imports to `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `gymnasium`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and standard library modules. Calls to `os.system`, `os.popen`, `eval`, `exec`, and `execve` are explicitly blocked regardless of how they are invoked.

### Subprocess Isolation

Scripts run in a subprocess with a stripped environment — only `PATH`, `HOME`, `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`, and TensorFlow thread-count variables are set — with a configurable hard timeout (default: 10 minutes). Per-process resource limits are applied on Linux via `resource.setrlimit`:

| Limit | Value | Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU time (`RLIMIT_CPU`) | 600s soft / 660s hard | `MAX_TRAINING_MINUTES` | Prevents runaway training loops |
| File size (`RLIMIT_FSIZE`) | 10 GB | `MAX_OUTPUT_GB` | Prevents disk-fill attacks |

Memory is capped at the Docker container level (`mem_limit`) rather than via `RLIMIT_AS` — virtual address space limits cause TensorFlow thread-pool failures when `RLIMIT_AS` is set too low.

### Docker Sandbox

The Celery worker container runs with an additional layer of Docker-level hardening:

- **Seccomp profile** (`worker-seccomp.json`): Blocks dangerous syscalls including `ptrace`, `mount`, `pivot_root`, `bpf`, `kexec_load`, `add_key`, and others. `clone` is permitted (required by `subprocess.Popen`); namespace-related syscalls (`unshare`, `setns`, `pivot_root`) remain blocked.
- **Capability restrictions**: `cap_drop: ALL` with only `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`, and `CHOWN` re-added
- **Process limits**: `nproc=65536`, `nofile=65536` (TensorFlow and data loaders spawn many threads)
- **Memory cap**: `mem_limit` default 12 GB RAM + 16 GB swap (configurable via `MAX_MEMORY_GB`)

Each session's files are isolated in a per-session directory that no other session can access.

## Recent Updates

### v0.8.0 — Reliable Research Pipeline (arXiv PDFs + Context7 Docs)

The research phase has been completely reworked to eliminate the two root causes of bad model generation: wrong paper content and inaccurate Keras API usage.

**arXiv — correct paper selection and full PDF ingestion**
- Replaced `fetch_arxiv_papers` + `fetch_url` + `ingest_url` (3 fragile tools) with two focused tools:
  - `search_arxiv` — queries the arXiv API and returns titles, abstracts, and `arxiv_id` fields. The model reads abstracts to select the most relevant papers — no blind fetching
  - `ingest_arxiv_paper(arxiv_id)` — backend constructs `arxiv.org/pdf/{id}` directly from the ID returned by search; no URL construction or guessing by the model. Downloads the full PDF and indexes it into FAISS
- Eliminated the failure mode where the model would hallucinate or mis-construct arXiv URLs, causing it to fetch wrong or empty content and then make up architecture decisions

**TensorFlow/Keras docs — replaced DuckDuckGo scraping with Context7**
- Replaced `search_tensorflow_docs` (DuckDuckGo → scraped HTML → 4000-word truncated snippet) with `fetch_tensorflow_docs(topic)`, which fetches real code examples and API signatures directly from [Context7](https://context7.com) (keras.io primary, tensorflow/docs secondary)
- Context7 returns structured, code-first documentation with correct API signatures — not scraped navigation HTML
- Docs are ingested directly into the session FAISS vector store; no content is passed back through the model context

**Backend**
- `POST /platform/vectorstore/{session_id}/ingest` now accepts an optional `text` field; when provided, the HTTP download is skipped entirely (used by the Context7 docs path)
- HTTP fetch timeout on ingest raised from 60s → 90s to accommodate large PDFs

### v0.7.0 — Research → Plan → Build Pipeline

The entire code-generation workflow has been rearchitected around a three-phase pipeline backed by a real vector store:

**Research phase (new)**
- `fetch_url` now triggers `ingest_url`, which downloads the full paper independently (no truncation) and indexes it into a per-session **FAISS vector store** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings from sentence-transformers
- Papers are chunked at 400 words with 80-word overlap and stored with source URL + title metadata
- arXiv abstract truncation raised from 500 → 2000 characters; PDF fetch timeout raised from 10s → 45s
- New `finalize_research` tool transitions the session to planning phase after all sources are indexed

**Planning phase (new)**
- Agent queries the vector store with `query_research` (minimum 6 targeted queries) to retrieve the most relevant chunks before writing a single line of code
- `produce_plan` submits a structured **Plan Document** covering: problem framing, feature engineering, architecture with mathematical justification, hyperparameters with source citations, training strategy, and evaluation metrics
- Every hyperparameter and architecture decision cites a specific retrieved chunk's source URL — no more decisions from training-data priors
- The plan is shown to the user for review and approval before build begins

**Build phase (enforced)**
- `edit_script`, `create_notebook`, and `run_code` are hard-locked until `approve_plan` is called
- The backend enforces this at the API level (HTTP 403 if phase is not `approved` or `building`)
- Every in-code comment references the approved plan section or paper source
- Session phase persisted to disk (`phase.txt`, `plan.md`) — survives backend restarts within TTL

**Infrastructure**
- New `backend/vectorstore.py` module: FAISS index management, sentence-transformers embedding, chunking, per-session asyncio locks
- New backend endpoints: `POST /platform/vectorstore/{session_id}/ingest`, `POST /platform/vectorstore/{session_id}/query`, `GET/POST /platform/session/{session_id}/phase`
- Embedding model pre-warmed at startup (avoids 5–15s first-request latency)
- New dependencies: `faiss-cpu>=1.8.0`, `sentence-transformers>=3.0.0`, `pypdf>=4.0.0`
- `stepCountIs` limit raised from 25 → 40 to accommodate the research + planning tool budget

### v0.6.0 — Reinforcement Learning + Large Uploads + Script Reliability
- **RL support**: Full PPO, DQN, and SAC generation with custom Gymnasium environments. Separate validator rules for RL scripts (no `model.fit()` required; saves `actor.keras`/`critic.keras`/`qnetwork.keras`). `patch_canonical_plots` skips RL scripts to avoid crashes on custom training loops.
- **Large file uploads**: Uploads up to 500 MB now go directly from the browser to the backend (`NEXT_PUBLIC_UPLOAD_URL`), bypassing Next.js proxy buffering. Starlette multipart parser raised to 10 GB part limit via manual `MultiPartParser` instantiation.
- **CSV delimiter auto-detection**: `csv.Sniffer` detects comma, semicolon, tab, and pipe delimiters automatically on upload.
- **Script write/validate flow**: The agent now writes scripts via `edit_script(old_str="__REPLACE_ALL__")` before calling `create_notebook` with only a description. This eliminates JSON serialisation corruption of large Python scripts passed through tool arguments.
- **Script always saved on validation failure**: `generated_script.py` is written before validation so `read_script` and `edit_script` are always available after a failed `create_notebook`, breaking the rewrite loop.
- **`edit_script` accepts `__REPLACE_ALL__`**: Lets the agent replace the entire script in one call when facing widespread syntax or indentation errors.
- **arXiv full-paper reading**: `fetch_url` rewrites `arxiv.org/abs/` → `arxiv.org/html/` to fetch full paper text instead of abstract-only pages, with fallback for papers without HTML rendering.
- **`run_code` tool**: Agent can now execute Python snippets in the session directory to inspect data, verify column names/shapes, and test logic before writing the full script.

### v0.5.0 — Context Efficiency
- **Anthropic**: system prompt cached via `cache_control: ephemeral` — reduces cost and latency on every request
- **Anthropic**: server-side `contextManagement` automatically clears old tool-use results (arXiv/TF doc fetches) when context exceeds 60k tokens, keeping the last 3 tool turns
- **OpenAI / LM Studio**: `pruneMessages` strips tool call results older than the last 5 message turns before sending
- Long sessions no longer hit rate limits or degrade in quality as conversation history grows

### v0.4.0 — Docker Sandbox + Plot Gallery
- Worker container hardened with seccomp profile, capability restrictions, and resource limits
- Generated scripts automatically save matplotlib/seaborn figures to session output
- Plot thumbnails appear in the Downloads panel after compilation; click to open full-size lightbox
- `Saving plots…` spinner prevents false "no plots" states during post-compilation file writes
- Epochs badge shows exact training duration and EarlyStopping status

### v0.3.0 — Time Series Forecasting
- Automatic detection of datetime columns and sampling frequency
- LSTM, Stacked LSTM, and Temporal Fusion Transformer architecture selection
- Correct `timeseries_dataset_from_array` windowing (no data leakage)
- `energy_consumption_sample.csv` sample dataset included
- Notebook environment setup cells added for Linux/WSL2 CPU, NVIDIA GPU, and Google Colab

### v0.2.0 — Training Metrics Visualisation
- Live loss/accuracy chart appears inline during compilation, streamed epoch-by-epoch via SSE
- Click the expand icon to open a full-size chart with tooltip, legend, and stat pills
- Dual-axis layout: loss on the left, accuracy percentage on the right
- Built with Recharts + shadcn-style `ChartContainer` component
